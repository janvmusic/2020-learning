### Chapter 19 - Event Loop
- Understanding event loop give us awareness of how it works, how events occur.
- When we call functions, they are placed in a `Call Stack` waiting for it's turn to run
- This could be good for a deterministic approach, it means that one function runs after the previous
- However in real life we have:
  - HTTP calls
  - AJAX
  - etc
- So for this reason, when an event occurs it's handed to the event loop
- The event loop is a `process` that keeps listening in case of any event occurs
- When this happens, the event loop pickups the task and performs it
- It also takes care of updating browsers view
- The whole user experience will depend on of how optimized your code for the event loop
- In modern browsers **updating** the view usually consists in 4 steps:
  - Checking for `requestAnimationFrame`
  - CSS style calculation
  - Determine layout position
  - Render
- Never use setTimeout or setInterval to render stuffs. It's a bad practice
- Instead use CSS to create smooth animations
