## Notes & Concepts
- Hoisting: default behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope before code execution. Functions and variables are moved to the top before it's execution
- Hosting: assigning values to variables that don't exist, creates a variable in global scope.
- Marshalling: convert objects from memory to a format that can be written to disk
- `var` can cause hoisting bugs, prefer to use `let` or `const`
- **High-order functions**: because they take another function as argument or return a function
- **Rendering** is the act of displaying something in the screen
- A **class** is an abstract representation of an object
- Prototype Inheritance: Create between links and parents objects
